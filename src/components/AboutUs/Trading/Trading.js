      <p>
        We trade for our own account in major markets across the globe. No
        outside investors. No third party funds. So we can be innovative and
        nimble, while using our market experience to prudently manage risk. We
        have the team and infrastructure in place to drive business forward
        without the inefficiencies that hold back other organizations. Not many
        places do things like we do, and we like it that way.
